@OliversWilde @avfpev Sure, and my high was $30. Low was $2
@avfpev I bought BTC at a high when I first got in and it dropped 90%. To play this game, you need to be able to withstand a 90% drop...

@cryptoobsession @torgsl @alyssamaharani You can help. I can't do everything myself! \xf0\x9f\x98\x80
@HaukeMarxen No, and that's what I said.
@IsaiBCortez Is a BTC/LTC trade a like-kind trade and not taxed? Should we do LIFO or FIFO accounting for crypto taxes?
@cryptoobsession @torgsl @alyssamaharani Sure, things I do can influence the price up or down. But I can't control the price.
@CRYPT0N1TE The 1 factor is physical possession. 2nd factor is something you know like passphrase.
@CryptoTraderTV I like both. Ledger cost less though.
@m4d10x Was, because the model is now replaced with newer gen
@cryptoobsession @torgsl @alyssamaharani If I control the price, LTC would have gone up more than BTC.
To be clear, current Trezor cannot be hacked with a keylogger. Just the passphrase was susceptible, and that reduces security to 1-factor.
@IsaiBCortez Ask them to not charge tax on small purchases using crypto.
@TREZOR @ChrisBlec Of course. And neither would intercepting your pin.\n\nIt just reduces your security from 2-factor to 1-factor.
@whatcanudoman @MattCongdon1 @The_Crypto_Guy @Frauenfelder I would recommend adding a passphrase. It's much more safer.
@ponchomayto @Bitso Will see what I can do.
@torgsl @alyssamaharani Come on! Unrecoverable? Did you forget where it was earlier this year? And I can't control price. You can.

@EmanuLBlokchain Yes, only 2 miners though. 500 MH/s. And this is just another altcoin. Nothing special.
Maybe this miner is using ASICBOOST, so it might be mining optimally. Explains why Bcash is so against SegWit, as that kills ASICBOOST.
I estimate the amount of hashrate by this unknown miner is 500 Petahash/s. That's ~35,000 Antminer S9's! ($44MM worth) mining sub-optimally.

Meanwhile, these 2 unknown miners (https://t.co/8p5i4J4X70 &amp; https://t.co/73z5WXz15V) have mined 65,000 BCH ($26MM) and have not moved them.
@zxjoutlook Yes, SegWit and LN is going to help Bitcoin scale.
@radix42 Depends on how fast they mine the next 7 blocks.
Lastly, why is such a broken coin worth so much? Who's propping up the price and why? Will price keep \xf0\x9f\x93\x89 as miners speed mine and cash out? \xf0\x9f\xa4\x94
